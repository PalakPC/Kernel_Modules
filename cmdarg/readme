Kernel Module to print a string given as command-line argument to log.

Run the make command and insert the module through the command 
sudo insmod cmdarg.ko message='<string>' 

It prints the string to log, which can be viewed using the command 
dmesg|tail -10

Can't handle spaces right now. So, incomplete.
