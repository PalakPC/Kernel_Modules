Kernel Module to print a string given as command-line argument to log.

The code copies the string given as command-line argument to another string and then prints it to log. The second string is allocated memory through kmalloc().

Run the make command and insert the module through the command 
sudo insmod cmdarg.ko message=<string> 

It prints the string to log, which can be viewed using the command 
dmesg|tail -10

The string cannot contain spaces.
